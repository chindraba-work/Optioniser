Toggle Options: These options are for any binary options accessible to the command-line. On/Off, True/False, Yes/No, Enable/Disable, etc. The long and abbreviated option names are only availabe as bare options to set their option to true. The long and abbreviated options can be prefixed with '--no-' or '--skip-' which are also only available as bare options and which are false settings. The short options, when used bare, are a true setting. Adding a touching '+' sign to the right of the short option is also a true setting, and unneeded but acceptable. Replacing the '+' with a '-' is a false setting. When using the short option in a compacted group of short options the touching '+' or '-' will be applied and the group will not be broken. There are no trapped error conditions associated with toggle options. A possible error associate with toggle options is a trailing '=' in either long-option or short-option versions. With long-options, the training '=' will result in an "Unknown option: 'long-option='" error. With a short-option, either as part of a compacted set, or a single option, the trailing '=' will result in an "Unknown option: '='" error.
Of note is that none of the long-option-name, or abbrev-option formats have a value component of any style. The short-option format has an optional value of '+' or '-' only when touching, not '=' or space-separated.
