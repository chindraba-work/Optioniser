#
# Alternatives are:
# keep: Remainder of arguments is reset, without any processing, into
#   the $@ variable for the rest of the script to access. If unknown
#   is 'rebuild' the saved unknown options will be prefaced to the
#   arguments following the '--'. The unknown options will also be
#   saved for the local script, if the command should return.
# drop: The remainder of the arguments are ignored and processing of
#   arguments ends at the '--' marker and the script continues.
